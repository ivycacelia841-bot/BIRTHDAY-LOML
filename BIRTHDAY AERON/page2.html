Thank you for existing in my life and for bringing so much joy, laughter, and love into it. Since the day you came, everything feels brighter and more colorful. You’ve taught me what it means to feel cared for, appreciated, and truly loved. I don’t think I could ever thank you enough for being you, for your patience, your kindness, and the way you always make me feel like I’m the luckiest person alive.

On your special day, I just berharap you panjang umur, sentiasa sihat, and dijauhkan dari segala benda jahat. I want nothing but the best for you, because you deserve the world and more. No matter what challenges life throws at us, remember that I’ll always stand by your side, supporting you, cheering for you, and loving you through every high and low.

I’m so proud of the person you’ve become and so excited for everything that’s yet to come in your life. May this new chapter at 21 bring you even more happiness, opportunities, and success. And I hope we’ll continue to grow together, creating countless memories, adventures, and beautiful moments side by side.

Here’s to you, my love, to more laughter, more growth, and more love in the years ahead. Happiest 21st, baby. You’ll always be my greatest blessing.
